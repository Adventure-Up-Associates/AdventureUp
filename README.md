# AdventureUp
A small simple app for sharing adventures, and finding new ones roulette style

The inspiration for this app is for the many people that yearn for new adventure, but are not quite motivated enough, or often stricken by anxiety from the sheer volume of impersonal sites and options. Instead, this application aims to do several things for our users:
* We take the burden of the initial search away from the user (don't have to have _any_ idea on what they want to do, no problem!), by implementing a roulette style wheel/randomizer, that allows the user to cycle through fun ideas that are available.
* We make things more personal, by having users enter in personal adventures that people have done themselves. 


Future functionalities of this app include:
* An user login functionality (which we already have) that links into a comment and favorites' function (which we don't have). 
* Additional changes to make the web app feel less cluttered, more minimal, and yet still aesthetically pleasing.
