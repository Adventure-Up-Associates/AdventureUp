"If you're a fan of top-notched improvised piano performances, and loudly karaoking with a bunch of semi-drunk people, then check out Keys on Main in the evenings around 9. Two people on opposing pianos will take song requests and begin playing them while interacting with the crowd. If you have a group of friends that enjoy that type of activity and will go with you there, it's guaranteed to be a blast.",

The trail runs parallel to the Little Cottonwood Creek most of the way, and is constantly in the shades of trees. It's a mostly flat trek, and a respectable 5.1 miles from beginning to end. If you like biking, it also does allow bikes.",

There a number of fun activities of varying difficulty levels that you can do once there. You can zipline from the top of the park all the way down to the bottom, try your hands at obstacle courses, or bungie jumping.

Easier with a someone experienced, but if you want the challenge, it's doable without one. Just make sure to bring ample food and water, and leave early, as it is a fairly long trail, at a little over 8 miles.",

VALUES ("Reading a book series backwards",
"I once read Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series mostly backwards, jumping to the last entry in the series after finishing the namesake book of the series. It was an interesting way of consuming the story, as existing character personalities and motivations supposedly clear would be unclear. As a result, the meaning behind events are delayed, often only hinted at, and obscured until an earlier book is read where the character's backstory is explored. If you haven't done this at least once, give it a try.",

Yet we keep moving forward under the same goals and motivations set by our earlier selves, because we don't know any better. This is stumbling through life. Meditate on your new self, constantly update yourself on what your life goals and most important aspects are. Reset your direction.",
